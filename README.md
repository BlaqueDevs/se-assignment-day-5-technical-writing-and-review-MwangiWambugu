Flowcharts and network diagrams are ideal for illustrating processes and relationships, while bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts are best for comparing quantities, showing trends, and displaying proportions. Infographics combine text, images, and data visualizations to explain complex information, and maps are useful for location-based data. Technical drawings like blueprints and 3D models are essential for detailed designs, and tables are effective for presenting numerical data and comparisons. Icons and symbols quickly represent concepts, and animations or videos dynamically explain processes. By choosing the right visual, you can enhance understanding, engagement, and retention of technical information."""
## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
"""Headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents by breaking up text, guiding readers, establishing a logical hierarchy, facilitating navigation, enhancing comprehension, aiding in revision, and improving accessibility, making the content more structured and easier to follow."""
